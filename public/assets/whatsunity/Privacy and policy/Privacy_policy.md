# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: 2026-04-30**

This Privacy Policy explains how WhatsUnity ("the Application"), developed by Nour Adawy ("the Service Provider"), collects, uses, and protects your information.

## 1. Information Collection and Use
We collect information necessary to provide a secure and efficient community management experience:
*   **Personal Identity:** Full Name, Username, Phone Number, Email Address.
*   **Residency Details:** Owner/Tenant status, Apartment Number, Building Number, and Compound ID.
*   **Media Assets:** The app requires frequent access to your device's photo and video gallery (via `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` and `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` permissions) to enable core features like sharing multiple media files in community chat, uploading videos/photos for maintenance tickets, and setting profile pictures.
*   **Device Data:** IP address, operating system, and unique device identifiers for push notifications.
*   **Billing & Subscriptions:** For premium community plans and in-app purchases, transactions are processed securely through Google Play Billing. We do not collect or store your raw credit card information. We only store purchase verification tokens provided by Google Play to grant access to premium features.

## 2. Residency Verification
To maintain community security, we may request **Proof of Ownership** (utility bills, contracts, or deeds).
*   **Storage:** These documents are stored in a restricted **Appwrite Storage** bucket with strict access controls.
*   **Access:** Only authorized community administrators and system auditors can view these files.
*   **Purpose:** Exclusively used to resolve residency conflicts and verify unit occupancy.

## 3. Data Storage & Third-Party Services
WhatsUnity utilizes a multi-layered storage strategy to ensure high performance and offline availability:
*   **Appwrite Cloud:** Our primary backend for authentication, databases, and realtime sync.
*   **SQLite (Local):** Your data is cached locally on your device to support offline functionality.
*   **Cloudflare R2:** Used for hosting static files (images, PDFs, documents).
*   **Gumlet:** Used for processing and streaming high-quality voice notes and video messages.
*   **Firebase/FCM:** Used for delivering push notifications to Android and iOS devices.

## 4. Location Data
The Application may collect device location data to provide compound-specific recommendations and verify community proximity. You can manage location permissions through your device settings.

## 5. User Content Rights
You retain ownership of all content you upload. By using the Application, you grant us a license to store, process, and display this content within your specific community context. We do not sell your personal data to third-party advertisers.

## 6. Security
We implement industry-standard encryption and procedural safeguards to protect your data. This includes SSL/TLS for data in transit and AES encryption for sensitive documents stored in our cloud buckets.
